\begin{frame}{Getting Started}
\begin{itemize}
   \itemsep8pt
   \item You do not have to install anything to get started
   \item You can use Overleaf: \link{https://www.overleaf.com}{https://www.overleaf.com}
   \item In the long run, however, we recommend an installed version of \LaTeX{}
   \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep4pt
      \item Linux already has a package available (\T{apt}: \bbash{sudo apt install texlive-full})\par
      Otherwise: \link{https://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html}{https://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html}
      \item For Windows you can use \link{https://miktex.org/download}{Mik\TeX} in combination with an IDE like \link{https://www.texstudio.org/\#download}{\TeX studio}
      \item For MacOS there are great \link{https://www.latexbuch.de/latex-apple-mac-os-x-installieren/}{tutorials}
      \item Even for iPad there are Apps like \link{https://www.texpad.com/}{\TeX pad}
